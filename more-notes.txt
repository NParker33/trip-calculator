*NOTE: For the actual formula, the tank/number of tanks won't matter. That's purely for visualization purposes. Only the actual milleage is required (Tallahassee => Jacksonville = 177 miles * 2 trips = 354 miles)

Filling up at around $4.50 per gallon costs about (17.1 gallons * $4.50) $76.50. *NOTE: This may not matter either. Only focus on milleage and gallons.

Farthest you can go on one tank of gas: mpg * tanksize => 22mpg * 17.1 = 376.2;

End goal: how much money will you end up spending on gas? 

How are you determining how much gas to get? 
	1) How long is the trip? 177 miles, 354 miles round trip
	2) 

? Calculate the price of a full tank of gas, then use a percentage to figure out how much each trip will be?? That may also be the maxMiles that I've been trying to calculate.
